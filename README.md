**Hello there** 👋🍵

I’m Laura and this is my Github profile! Here I store what I have been learning about data analytics and I'm always trying to keep it well updated. 

I’m interested in Data Analytics Engineering, because i love using technical skills to provide business insights and decisions.😄💻

🌱 I’m currently learning Python.
